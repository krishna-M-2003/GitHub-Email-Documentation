### How to add your email address on GitHub so that you can receive the Playwright Test Report via mail

* Goto the URL https://github.com/

* The profile icon can be found in the top right corner of the screen, typically represented by a small image or initials. 
It is used to access personal settings, account information, and to log in or log out of the platform.

* Click the profile icon.

* After reviewing the information, click the 'Confirm' button to finalize your action and proceed with the next step.

* At this point, an email has been sent to the owner of the provided email address, containing a verification link that they must click to confirm and authenticate your email address.

* Go to your inbox and open the email that has been sent to you from our system to proceed with the verification process.

* A green button will appear in the email with the text 'Verify email address.' Clicking this button will initiate the process of confirming your email address and completing the verification step.

* Is the button not working?

* Copy the following link and paste it into the address bar of your browser to manually access the verification page and complete the process

* That's it! Once the Playwright tester is executed, or when developers push new changes or trigger any other action, the GitHub Action will automatically start running the tests. After the tests are completed, the results—whether they are marked as 'pass', 'fail', 'skip', or 'flaky'—will be compiled into a report and sent to the email addresses associated with the GitHub repository.
